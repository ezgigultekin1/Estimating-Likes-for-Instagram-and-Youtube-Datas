Visual Analysis: Learning Curves
Instagram Learning Curves
GradientBoosting

Observation: Both training and cross-validation errors are very low, indicating high model performance.
NeuralNetwork

Observation: High variance in the beginning with a significant reduction, indicating the model benefits from more training data.
RandomForest

Observation: Low error values suggesting a well-fitted model.
XGBoost

Observation: Similar to GradientBoosting, indicating robustness.
YouTube Learning Curves
GradientBoosting

Observation: Higher errors compared to Instagram, indicating more complexity in YouTube data.
NeuralNetwork

Observation: Higher variance and error compared to Instagram, suggesting a need for further tuning or more complex features.
RandomForest

Observation: High cross-validation error indicating overfitting.
XGBoost

Observation: Moderate performance but still higher error compared to Instagram.
